### Requirements to run this bot

1. Python 3.8 (Preferably)
2. MySQL Server
3. ffmpeg
4. `venv` and `pipenv`
5. Optionally you can install `pm2` (globally) which is a Node.js module to manage processes. Since `pm2` can also
   manage Python processes, I use it to run the bot in production. No Node.js/JavaScript knowledge is required. Just
   install `pm2` and run convenient script runners using pipenv. If you want to run the bot using other process
   managers, that's fine.
